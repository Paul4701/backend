4 types of stream

Readable -- used for read operation
Writeable -- used for write operation
Duplex -- it can be used for both read and write operation
Transform -- type of stream where output is computed based  on input


each type of stream is an eventEmitter instance and throws several events at different instance of times 
for example 
data-this event is fired when there is data available to read
end- this event is fired whhen there is no data to read
error- this event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data 
finish-this event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system



   // var fs=require('fs')
    // fs.readFile('note.txt',(err,data)=>{
    //   if(err) return console.error(err);
    //   console.log(data.toString())
    //   res.end(data.toString())
    // })
